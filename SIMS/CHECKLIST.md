# Checklist for Ultrasound Beamforming Simulation Codebase

**Overall Progress: 100%**

## Completed Tasks
- [x] **Beamforming Utilities (SIMS/beamforming_utils.py):**
  - Implmented piston model using `scipy.special.j1` with fallback to `np.sinc`.
  - Covered tissue attenuation function.
- [x] **Focused Beamforming Simulation: Frequency Sweep (SIMS/wavephasefocsweep.py):**
  - Dynamic update of wavelength and phase constant.
  - Proper handling of apodization and geometric spreading.
  - Visualization of coherent and RSS fields.
- [x] **Focused Beamforming Simulation (SIMS/wavephasefocused.py):**
  - Incorporates delay-and-sum phase correction.
  - Supports selectable apodization.
  - Computes and displays both coherent and RSS pressure fields.
- [x] **Synchronous Beamforming Simulation (SIMS/wavephasesync.py):**
  - Implements synchronous excitation with zero phase delay.
  - Provides vectorized computation for coherent and envelope (RSS) fields.
- [x] **Frequency Sweep for Synchronous Beamforming (SIMS/wavephasesyncsweep.py):**
  - Sweeps through frequencies (140 kHz to 220 kHz) to update parameters.
  - Composite field computation using arithmetic mean (coherent) and RMS (RSS) methods.
- [x] **General Improvements:**
  - Addressed unused and deprecated imports.
  - Ensured adherence to PEP8 standards and inline documentation is updated.
  - Verified that all simulations follow DRY principles by reusing common functions.

## Pending / Future Enhancements
- [ ] Investigate numerical stability and advanced error handling (e.g., for near-zero divisions).
- [ ] Explore additional apodization techniques (beyond Hanning/Hamming).
- [ ] Optimize broadcasting where possible for minor performance improvements.
