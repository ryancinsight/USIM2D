# Ultrasound Beamforming Simulation Codebase

## Overview
This codebase provides a suite of simulation scripts to model ultrasound beamforming using both focused and synchronous approaches. The simulations incorporate physical parameters such as element directivity (implemented with a piston model and a fallback sinc function), tissue attenuation, geometric spreading, and frequency-dependent updates. Both coherent and envelope (RSS) fields are computed and visualized.
